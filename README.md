## systemctl services
In each folder, there are examples of how I've installed some tools on CentOS 8 and created for them service files.  
One of the advantages of using services in comparison to simply run as a daemon is that services are controlled and reload by the OS. 
Also, there are tools like CentOS Cockpit that allow checking the status of the system services using WebUI.
